# React Testing Library & Jest Testing

Test examples using React with Typescript. As you can see this isn't laid out in a neat way. If you want to see what the page looks like in the browser, uncomment/comment out the desired component in main.tsx.

Yes... I could have used React Router, but I didn't care enough to set it up for this example project.
